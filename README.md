Outside of academics, I am passionate about sports. I love playing cricket and football, which help me stay active and focused.In my free time, I enjoy playing games. It's a great way to relax and unwind while also keeping my mind sharp.
As I continue my studies, I aim to deepen my knowledge in AI and data sciences, work on exciting projects, and contribute to innovative solutions in these fields. I also hope to balance my academic pursuits with my love for sports and gaming.
